# Local-Food-Wastage-Management
Food wastage is a significant issue, with many households and restaurants discarding surplus food while numerous people struggle with food insecurity. This project aims to develop a Local Food Wastage Management System, where:
●	Restaurants and individuals can list surplus food.
●	NGOs or individuals in need can claim the food.
●	SQL stores available food details and locations.
●	A Streamlit app enables interaction, filtering, CRUD operation and visualization.
